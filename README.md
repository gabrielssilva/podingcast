# About Podingcast

Podingcast is a lightweight podcasts feed and player. No fancy features. Just add and manage your feed, download episodes, and play as you like. After all, that is what you want. Right?

## More about Podingcast...

Some time ago I was willing to learn more about Android, exploring some more advanced platform features (like Services and Notifiers). Then I decided to start a new project.

At the same time, I never found a cool podcasts app for Android. I tried a bunch of them, and always found something to destroy my experience. It was natural to put the two ideas together, and finally I was starting to code Podingcast.

# Next Steps

I finished the first release with the features I had planned, but I am not satisfied with my current architecture. I will keep the app off from Play Store until I finish the fun process of refactor-every-single-thing. Not really every-single-thing, but mostly the Services, and mainly the persistence.

I also plan to build a new UI. You know, play around with some animations.
